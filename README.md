# City Explorer

**Author**: James Brooks
**Version**: 4.0.0

## Overview

This project is a simple app that when the name of city in the US is inputted into the form it will give return as accurate an address of that city as possible along with the Latitude and Longitude that the city is at then displays a map image of that city. Then using the data retrieved from that, it also displays a three day weather forecast for that location and a list of movies that have that city name in the title. The problem domain of a site like this is a shared one, the desire for information.

## Getting Started

To get this app working, you need to have a REACT_APP_SERVER in a `.env` file stored on the root directory of the repo. As well as running `npm install` and making sure it installed Axios and React-Bootstrap.

## Architecture

This app uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript at base; and uses the libraries of React, React Bootstrap, and Axios.
